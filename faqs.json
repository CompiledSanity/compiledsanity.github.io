				"Question": "How do I know my Data is kept private?",
				"Answer": [
					"A very valid question! The Sheet has been designed to be completely self-contained. When you download the Sheet and make a copy, it's now it's own independent copy hosted by <i>you</i>. The external services permission is triggered because the Sheet uses live Crypto, Stock and Managed Fund prices which requires the sheet to fetch external prices from Google Finance, Yahoo Finance & Bloomberg.<br><br>",
					"You can review all the formulas to see how that works, but it's strictly a one way fetch process and if you go Tools -> Script Editor in the Document you can review all the code yourself to make sure it checks out. Furthermore, no personally identifying information or sensitive information such as passwords/usernames are needed nor requested. The only inputs into this Sheet are holdings and amounts, the minimum information needed to determine your Net Worth & associated performance."

			{
				"Question": "Can I use the Sheet with Excel, Offline or Libre Office?",
				"Answer": [
					"Unfortunately no, as the Sheet is heavily reliant on Google Sheet functions for live pricing, custom Google formulas and most importantly the behind the scenes scripts written in Google Apps Scripts. You may download the Sheet and try importing into Excel, but you will find that significant elements of the Sheet will not work and it is therefore heavily not recommended. <br>",

				"Question": "How do I use the tool if I'm paid fortnightly?",

					"When it comes to the Sheet however, all calculations are strictly performed in the month timescale. This is to enable a lot of date functions to work on a standardized timescale. So tracking and statistics will be performed at the monthly time scale."

				"Question": "How do I enter and account for my Mortgage Offset Account?",
				"Answer": [
					"Mortgage Offset accounts can be dealt with in many different ways. Uniquely, Offset accounts can count as both a Cash account as well as downpayments on your loan. Since this money can flex in between it can be a grey area, but for the purposes of the Sheet it needs to be more definite.",
					"<br><br>",
					"It is recommended that you come up with a theoretical minimum floor/emergency Cash amount that you have earmarked for emergencies, investments or general purchases ($30,000 for example). This $30,000 balance would go in the Cash tab as 'Offset Account'.",
					"<br><br>",
					"In the Property tab for 'Mortgage amount paid' you would put the remainder of this balance (ie. Total Offset Balance - $30,000). That way as your Offset Cash balance grows, in the Sheet more of your mortgage will be reflected as paid off over time."

			{
				"Question": "How do I track with my partner?",
				"Answer": [
					"For couples it is recommended that you combine finances and incomes as expenses will likely be incurred as a household and not for individuals and therefore Net Worth changes need to be considered as a whole.",
					"<br><br>",
					"A key point when combining finances is the Tax rate input in the Sheet Options tab. For a couple in different tax brackets a weighted averaged will needs to be used. Please follow this formula and use the linked calculator for working this out:",
					"<br><br>",
					"<b>(Income1 x Tax1% + Income2 x Tax%2) / (Income1 + Income 2) = Average Tax Rate %</b>",

					"<ul>",
					"    <li>",
					"        <b>If you pay off your Credit cards each month</b> - Enter your credit card balance on the cash tab as a negative number. As this isn't long term debt it is more appropriate having it as an equalising negative Cash Balance for accuracy.",

					"<br><br>",

			{
				"Question": "How do I account for income from a rental Property?",

					"Income from Rental properties is entered into the Side Income tab. Rename one of the example columns as needed and enter the after-tax rent each month.
