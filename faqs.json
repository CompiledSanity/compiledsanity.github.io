This is so what if you wanted to audit the Sheet, you could go Tools -> Script Editor and verify what the code is doing yourself and have full transparency at any time. My personal believe is this is the only way to have a trusted and secure environment. Personally, published Google Sheet apps are a bit of a black box as the code cannot be reviewed and audited by yourself.",
