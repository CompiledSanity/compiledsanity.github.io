				"Question": "How do I know my Data is kept private?",
				"Answer": [
					"A very valid question! The Sheet has been designed to be completely self-contained. When you download the Sheet and make a copy, it's now it's own independent copy hosted by <i>you</i>. The external services permission is triggered because the Sheet uses live Crypto, Stock and Managed Fund prices which requires the sheet to fetch external prices from Google Finance, Yahoo Finance & Bloomberg.<br><br>",
					"You can review all the formulas to see how that works, but it's strictly a one way fetch process and if you go Tools -> Script Editor in the Document you can review all the code yourself to make sure it checks out. Furthermore, no personally identifying information or sensitive information such as passwords/usernames are needed nor requested. The only inputs into this Sheet are holdings and amounts, the minimum information needed to determine your Net Worth & associated performance."

					"<ol>",
					"    <li>Click File -> Version History -> See Version History</li>",
					"    <li>In the right Sidebar, click on the dated version of the Sheet <i>before</i> you clicked to end the month</li>",
					"    <li>At the top of the screen, click the green 'Restore this version' button</li>",
					"    <li>Finish off entering your data and run the Sheet again</li>",
