					"    <li>Starting in Cell A3 and working down, enter in the dates (ie. 1/6/2020, 1/7/2020 etc.) for the previous data you want in the sheet. Don't worry about the months already in the sheet, they will automatically move down.</li>",

			{
				"Question": "How do I know my Data is kept private?",
				"Answer": [
					"A very valid question! The Sheet has been designed to be completely self-contained. When you download the Sheet and make a copy, it's now it's own independent copy hosted by <i>you</i>. The external services permission is triggered because the Sheet uses live Crypto, Stock and Managed Fund prices which requires the sheet to fetch external prices from Google Finance, Yahoo Finance & Bloomberg.<br><br>",
					"You can review all the formulas to see how that works, but it's strictly a one way fetch process and if you go Tools -> Script Editor in the Document you can review all the code yourself to make sure it checks out. Furthermore, no personally identifying information or sensitive information such as passwords/usernames are needed nor requested. The only inputs into this Sheet are holdings and amounts, the minimum information needed to determine your Net Worth & associated performance."

			},
			{
				"Question": "Can I use the Sheet with Excel, Offline or Libre Office?",
				"Answer": [
					"Unfortunately no, as the Sheet is heavily reliant on Google Sheet functions for live pricing, custom Google formulas and most importantly the behind the scenes scripts written in Google Apps Scripts. You may download the Sheet and try importing into Excel, but you will find that significant elements of the Sheet will not work and it is therefore heavily not recommended. <br>",

				"Question": "How do I use the tool if I'm paid fortnightly?",
				"Answer": [
					"First off, in the SheetOptions tab set your pay Cycle to fornightly and update your fornightly pay value. This will help the Template understand your monthly pay.<br><br>",
					"When it comes to the Sheet however, all calculations are strictly performed in the month timescale. This is to enable a lot of date functions to work on a standardized timescale. So tracking and statistics will be performed at the monthly time scale."

				"Question": "The dates in my Sheets keep ticking over and my history isn't being recorded, why is this?",
				"Answer": [
					"To record the month of progress that you're in, it is critically important that you press the Red Update Button in the Net Worth Tab at least once a month (pictured below).<br><br>",
					"<p style='text-align: center;'><img style='max-width: 100%' src='img/RedNetWorthButton.png' alt='Red Net Worth Update button'/></p>",
					"This is so that you can enter in all your up to date values before pressing the button to record the month. If you do not press this button, the Sheet will keep ticking over to the next month until you update your Net Worth for the first time.<br><br>",
					"Please note:",
					"<ul>",
					"    <li>It is recommended that you update your Net Worth on the 1st of every month.</li>",

				"Question": "What does CompiledSanity stand for?",
				"Answer": [
					"CompiledSanity is the Reddit username of the creator of this Sheet, and the name by which the Sheet became known by when I first <a href='https: //www.reddit.com/r/fiaustralia/comments/f2fy01/after_a_year_of_work_im_releasing_my_net_worth/'>started sharing the Sheet on the internet.</a> While in hindsight I wish I could have named it something more approachable and easier on the eyes, by this time it was too late and the Sheet had become synonymous with 'CompiledSanity'.",
					"</br></br>",
					"The words themselves draw from programming workflows and some frustration I had with a particular task at the time.",

					"I may still change the name in the future, but for now it is best found on the internet by the name the Sheet is known by."
